    question: 'Is this online save editor safe to use?',
    answer:
      'Yes, it is 100% safe. SaveEditor.top runs entirely in your web browser (client-side). Your save files are never uploaded to any server, ensuring complete privacy and data security.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What games are supported?',
    answer:
      "We support thousands of games built on popular engines like RPG Maker (MV/MZ/VX Ace/XP), Unity, Ren'Py, Unreal Engine, GameMaker, and NaniNovel. Popular games include Stardew Valley, Undertale, Hollow Knight, DDLC, and many more.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to install any software?',
    answer:
      'No. This is a fully web-based tool. You can edit your save files directly from Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari on any device, including Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Where are my save files located?',
    answer:
      "Save file locations vary by game and OS. Common locations on Windows include %AppData%, My Documents/My Games, or the game's installation folder. On Mac, check ~/Library/Application Support. Check our game-specific pages for exact locations.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Will editing my save file corrupt my game?',
    answer:
      'Our editor validates changes to minimize corruption risk. However, we strongly recommend always backing up your save file before editing. Copy the original file to a safe location first.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I edit Steam/console game saves?',
    answer:
      'Steam PC saves work great with our editor. However, console (PlayStation, Xbox, Switch) saves are encrypted and not supported. Steam Cloud may restore original saves - consider disabling it temporarily.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I add unlimited gold/money?',
    answer:
      "Upload your save file, find the gold/money field in the editor (usually named 'gold', 'money', or 'currency'), change the value to your desired amount, then download and replace the original file.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I unlock all items or achievements?',
    answer:
      'Yes, for most games you can edit inventory arrays to add items and modify achievement flags. The exact method varies by game engine. Check our game-specific guides for detailed instructions.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What file formats are supported?',
    answer:
      "We support: RPG Maker (.rpgsave, .rmmzsave, .rvdata2, .rvdata, .rxdata), Ren'Py (.save), Unity (PlayerPrefs, .xml, .plist), Unreal (.sav), GameMaker (.ini, .json), NaniNovel (.nson), and generic JSON/XML files.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why can't I open my save file?",
    answer:
      "Some games use encrypted or proprietary formats. Try selecting a different editor type, or the file may be compressed. If you see 'Invalid file' error, the game might use a format we don't yet support.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Is this free? Are there any limits?',
    answer:
      'SaveEditor.top is completely free with no limits on file size or number of edits. We support ourselves through optional donations and non-intrusive ads.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I edit multiplayer or online game saves?',
    answer:
      'Single-player and local multiplayer saves can be edited. Online/MMO games typically store data on servers, which cannot be modified. Editing online game saves may violate terms of service.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I find a specific value in my save?',
    answer:
      "Use the search/filter feature in our editor to find specific field names. Common fields include 'hp', 'gold', 'level', 'items', 'inventory'. For complex saves, use JSON path navigation.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Does this work on mobile devices?',
    answer:
      'Yes! Our editor works on Android and iOS browsers. However, accessing save files on mobile can be tricky. For mobile games, saves are often in app-specific directories that require file manager apps to access.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I undo changes after editing?',
    answer:
      "Once you download the edited file, changes are permanent. That's why we always recommend keeping a backup of your original save file before making any modifications.",
  },
